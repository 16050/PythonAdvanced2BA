# PythonAdvanced2BA

This repository contains material related to the advanced programming course with Python targeted to 2nd year bachelor students. It contains the slides presented during the theoretical courses and the statements of the labs and projects. It also contains code examples and libraries used in the course.

Please look at the [course website](http://ecam-brussels.github.io/PythonAdvanced2BA/) to download all the available resources.

## Code examples

Code examples are organised by topics:

- Abstract Data Type (ADT)
- Artificial intelligence (AI)
- Concurrent programming
- Documents manipulation
- Functional programming
- Game programming
- Interface programming
- Network programming
- Regular Expression
- String manipulation

Some of the examples relies on external libraries:

- `bottle` 0.12.9 ([site web](http://www.bottlepy.org))
- `dispy` 4.6.10 ([site web](http://dispy.sourceforge.net))
- `kivy` 1.9.1 ([site web](https://kivy.org))
- `openpyxl` 2.3.4 ([site web](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.org))
- `pyfpdf` 1.7.2 ([site web](https://pyfpdf.readthedocs.org))
- `pypdf2` 1.25.1 ([site web](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2))
- `python-docx` 0.8.5 ([site web](https://python-docx.readthedocs.org))

The examples have been developed and tested with Python 3.5.1.
